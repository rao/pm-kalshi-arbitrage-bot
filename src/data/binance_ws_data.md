Websocket Market Streams
========================

*   The connection method for Websocket is：

    *   Base Url: **wss://fstream.binance.com**
    *   Streams can be access either in a single raw stream or a combined stream
    *   Raw streams are accessed at **/ws/<streamName>**
    *   Combined streams are accessed at **/stream?streams=<streamName1>/<streamName2>/<streamName3>**
    *   Example:
    *   `wss://fstream.binance.com/ws/bnbusdt@aggTrade`
    *   `wss://fstream.binance.com/stream?streams=bnbusdt@aggTrade/btcusdt@markPrice`

*   Combined stream events are wrapped as follows: **{"stream":"<streamName>","data":<rawPayload>}**

*   All symbols for streams are **lowercase**

*   A single connection is only valid for 24 hours; expect to be disconnected at the 24 hour mark

*   The websocket server will send a `ping frame` every 3 minutes. If the websocket server does not receive a `pong frame` back from the connection within a 10 minute period, the connection will be disconnected. Unsolicited `pong frames` are allowed(the client can send pong frames at a frequency higher than every 15 minutes to maintain the connection).

*   WebSocket connections have a limit of 10 incoming messages per second.

*   A connection that goes beyond the limit will be disconnected; IPs that are repeatedly disconnected may be banned.

*   A single connection can listen to a maximum of **1024** streams.

*   Considering the possible data latency from RESTful endpoints during an extremely volatile market, it is highly recommended to get the order status, position, etc from the Websocket user data stream.
