## Blocked Regions

In addition to fully blocked countries, the following specific regions within otherwise accessible countries are also restricted:

| Country      | Region  | Region Code |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------- |
| Canada (CA)  | Ontario | ON          |
| Ukraine (UA) | Crimea  | 43          |
| Ukraine (UA) | Donetsk | 14          |
| Ukraine (UA) | Luhansk | 09          |

## Blocking Logic

The geoblocking system includes:

1. **OFAC-Sanctioned Countries**: Countries sanctioned by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
2. **Additional Regulatory Restrictions**: Countries added for specific regulatory compliance reasons

### Close-Only Countries

Some countries have a **"close-only"** restriction status. Users in these countries can:

* ✅ Close existing positions
* ❌ Open new positions

Countries with close-only status include:

* Singapore (SG)
* Poland (PL)
* Thailand (TH)
* Taiwan (TW)

## Why These Restrictions?

Geographic restrictions are implemented to ensure compliance with:

* International sanctions and embargoes
* Local financial regulations
* Gambling and prediction market laws
* Anti-money laundering (AML) requirements
* Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations
