# Is Polymarket The House?

> No, Polymarket is not the house. All trades happen peer-to-peer (p2p).

## Polymarket is different in three ways:

### 1. Traders interact directly with each other, not with Polymarket.

Polymarket is a marketplace comprised of traders on both sides of any given market. This means you're always trading with other users, not against a centralized entity or "house." Prices on Polymarket are determined by supply and demand. As traders buy and sell shares in outcomes, prices fluctuate to reflect the collective sentiment and knowledge of market participants.

### 2. Polymarket does not charge trading fees.

Unlike bookmakers or wagering operations, Polymarket does not charge deposit/withdrawal fees, or any type of trading fees. This means that Polymarket does not stand to benefit from the outcome of any market or usage of any trader.

### 3. Transact at any time.

Polymarket enables you to sell your position at any time before the market resolves, provided there is a willing buyer of your shares. This offers flexibility and allows you to manage your risk and lock in profits or cut losses as you see fit.

In essence, Polymarket empowers you to trade based on your own knowledge and research, without going up against a "house" with potentially unfair advantages.
