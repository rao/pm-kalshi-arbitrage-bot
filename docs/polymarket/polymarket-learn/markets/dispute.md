# How Are Markets Disputed?

**Anyone can dispute a proposed market resolution if they feel it was proposed in error.**

Once a market is proposed for resolution it goes into a challenge period of 2 hours.

If no one challenges the proposal the resolution is deemed valid and the proposer receives their bond back plus the reward.

During the 2-hour challenge period, anyone may dispute the proposal on the [UMA dapp](https://oracle.uma.xyz/) by posting a challenge bond of the same amount as the proposer bond (usually \$750).

This begins the debate period of 24-48 hours (votes happen every other day and there will always be at least 24 hours for discussion). Anyone wishing to contribute evidence to the discussion can do so in the Uma Discord server in the #evidence-rationale and #voting-discussion channels.

After the debate period, Uma token holders vote (this process takes approximately 48 hours) and one of four outcomes happens:

## Outcomes

### Proposer wins

Proposer receives their bond back plus half the disputer’s bond as a bounty. Disputer loses their bond.

### Disputer wins

Disputer receives their bond back plus half the proposer’s bond as a bounty. Proposer loses their bond.

### Too Early

This outcome is for proposals for which the underlying event has not yet happened. Eg the result of a sports match that is still ongoing. Disputer receives their bond back plus half the proposer’s bond as a bounty. Proposer loses their bond.

### Unknown/50-50

This (rarely used) outcome is for events where none of the other options are appropriate. In this case the market price resolves to 50 yes and 50 no. Disputer receives their bond back plus half the proposer’s bond as a bounty. Proposer loses their bond.
