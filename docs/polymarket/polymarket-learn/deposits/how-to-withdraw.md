<Note>
  Note: When withdrawing USDC.e (bridged USDC) is swapped through the [Uniswap v3 pool](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xd36ec33c8bed5a9f7b6630855f1533455b98a418)
  for USDC (native) (the UI enforces less than 10bp difference in output
  amount). At times, this pool may be exhausted and for extremely large deposits
  there might not be enough liquidity. If you are having withdraw issues, try
  breaking your withdraw into smaller amounts or waiting for the pool to be
  rebalanced. Additionally, you can select to withdraw USDC.e directly which
  does not require any Uniswap liquidity; just be aware that some exchanges no
  longer allow USDC.e to be deposited directly.
