# Authentication

> Understanding authentication using Polymarket's CLOB

The CLOB uses two levels of authentication: **L1 (Private Key)** and **L2 (API Key)**.
Either can be accomplished using the CLOB client or REST API. Authentication is not
required to access client public methods and public endpoints.

## L1 Authentication

### What is L1?

L1 authentication uses the wallet's private key to sign an EIP-712 message used in the
request header. It proves ownership and control over the private key. The private key
stays in control of the user and all trading activity remains non-custodial.

### What This Enables

Access to L1 methods that create or derive L2 authentication headers.

* Create user API credentials
* Derive existing user API credentials
* Sign/create user's orders locally

### CLOB Client

### REST API

While we highly recommend using our provided clients to handle signing
and authentication, the following is for developers who choose NOT to
use our [Python](https://github.com/Polymarket/py-clob-client) or
[TypeScript](https://github.com/Polymarket/clob-client) clients.

When making direct REST API calls with L1 authentication, include these headers:

| Header           | Required? | Description            |
| ---------------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| `POLY_ADDRESS`   | yes       | Polygon signer address |
| `POLY_SIGNATURE` | yes       | CLOB EIP 712 signature |
| `POLY_TIMESTAMP` | yes       | Current UNIX timestamp |
| `POLY_NONCE`     | yes       | Nonce. Default 0       |

The `POLY_SIGNATURE` is generated by signing the following EIP-712 struct.

    ```typescript Typescript theme={null}
    const domain = {
      name: "ClobAuthDomain",

    };

    const types = {
      ClobAuth: [
        { name: "address", type: "address" },
        { name: "timestamp", type: "string" },

    const sig = await signer._signTypedData(domain, types, value);

**Create API Credentials**

Create new API credentials for user.

```bash  theme={null}
POST {clob-endpoint}/auth/api-key
```

**Derive API Credentials**

Derive API credentials for user.

```bash  theme={null}
GET {clob-endpoint}/auth/derive-api-key

**Response**

```json  theme={null}

**You'll need all three values for L2 authentication.**

## L2 Authentication

### What is L2?

The next level of authentication is called L2, and it consists of the
user's API credentials (apiKey, secret, passphrase) generated from L1
authentication. These are used solely to authenticate requests made to
the CLOB API. Requests are signed using HMAC-SHA256.

### What This Enables

Access to L2 methods such as posting signed/created orders, viewing open
orders, cancelling open orders, getting trades

* Cancel or get user's open orders
* Check user's balances and allowances
* Post user's signed orders

<Info>
  Even with L2 authentication headers, methods that create user orders still require the user to sign the order payload.

### REST API

While we highly recommend using our provided clients to handle signing
and authentication, the following is for developers who choose NOT to
use our [Python](https://github.com/Polymarket/py-clob-client) or
[TypeScript](https://github.com/Polymarket/clob-client) clients.

When making direct REST API calls with L2 authentication, include these headers:

| Header            | Required? | Description                   |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| `POLY_ADDRESS`    | yes       | Polygon signer address        |
| `POLY_SIGNATURE`  | yes       | HMAC signature for request    |
| `POLY_TIMESTAMP`  | yes       | Current UNIX timestamp        |
| `POLY_API_KEY`    | yes       | User's API `apiKey` value     |
| `POLY_PASSPHRASE` | yes       | User's API `passphrase` value |

The `POLY_SIGNATURE` for L2 is an HMAC-SHA256 signature created using the user's API credentials `secret` value.
Reference implementations can be found in the [Typescript](https://github.com/Polymarket/clob-client/blob/main/src/signing/hmac.ts)
and [Python](https://github.com/Polymarket/py-clob-client/blob/main/py_clob_client/signing/hmac.py) clients.

***

## Signature Types and Funder

When initializing the L2 client, you must specify your wallet **signatureType** and the **funder** address which holds the funds:

| Signature Type | Value | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EOA            | 0     | Standard Ethereum wallet (MetaMask). Funder is the EOA address and will need POL to pay gas on transactions.                                                                                 |
| POLY\_PROXY    | 1     | A custom proxy wallet only used with users who logged in via Magic Link email/Google. Using this requires the user to have exported their PK from Polymarket.com and imported into your app. |
| GNOSIS\_SAFE   | 2     | Gnosis Safe multisig proxy wallet (most common). Use this for any new or returning user who does not fit the other 2 types.                                                                  |

<Tip>
  The wallet addresses displayed to the user on Polymarket.com is the proxy wallet and should be used as the funder.
  These can be deterministically derived or you can deploy them on behalf of the user.
  These proxy wallets are automatically deployed for the user on their first login to Polymarket.com.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Error: INVALID_SIGNATURE">
    Your wallet's private key is incorrect or improperly formatted.

    **Solution:**

    * Verify your private key is a valid hex string (starts with "0x")
    * Ensure you're using the correct key for the intended address
    * Check that the key has proper permissions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error: NONCE_ALREADY_USED">
    The nonce you provided has already been used to create an API key.

    **Solution:**

    * Use `deriveApiKey()` with the same nonce to retrieve existing credentials
    * Or use a different nonce with `createApiKey()`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error: Invalid Funder Address">
    Your funder address is incorrect or doesn't match your wallet.

    **Solution:** Check your Polymarket profile address at [polymarket.com/settings](https://polymarket.com/settings).

    If it does not exist or user has never logged into Polymarket.com, deploy it first before creating L2 authentication.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Lost API credentials but have nonce">
    ```typescript  theme={null}
    // Use deriveApiKey with the original nonce
    const recovered = await client.deriveApiKey(originalNonce);
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Lost both credentials and nonce">
    Unfortunately, there's no way to recover lost API credentials without the nonce. You'll need to create new credentials:

    ```typescript  theme={null}
    // Create fresh credentials with a new nonce
    const newCreds = await client.createApiKey();
    // Save the nonce this time!
    ```
  </Accordion>
